# Unity Catalog UI (ui-new)

A rebuild of the Unity Catalog web UI as a same-origin SPA backed by a small Rust
bridge. It browses catalogs, schemas, tables, volumes, functions, and models, and
supports the existing cookie-based auth (or an auth-disabled mode).

- `web/` — the SPA: [Bun](https://bun.com/) + Vite + React 19, [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
  on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) v4, [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router)
  (file-based) + [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query), talking [Connect](https://connectrpc.com/docs/web/getting-started/)
  to the bridge via [connect-query](https://connectrpc.com/docs/web/query/).
- `server/` — the bridge: a Rust [axum](https://docs.rs/axum) service exposing
  typed Connect services for each catalog domain, the allowlisted
  `UnityProxyService/Call` used by control-plane and permissions calls,
  `/config`, and `/healthz`. Vite or Nginx serves the SPA.
- `proto/` — the typed domain services plus the generic control/permissions proxy;
  `buf.gen.yaml` generates the TypeScript clients.

## Architecture

```
Browser SPA  --Connect (same-origin)-->  Rust bridge  --REST-->  UC Java server
             <--Set-Cookie propagated--               <--------
```

The bridge being same-origin removes CORS. Auth stays cookie-based (the current
ui's model): the SPA calls `POST /auth/tokens` (token-exchange, `ext=cookie`) and
`GET /scim2/Me` through the passthrough; the bridge forwards the browser's cookie
to UC and copies UC's `Set-Cookie` back onto the (same-origin) response, so the
session lands in the browser. `GET /config` tells the SPA whether auth is enabled
and which providers to show — the runtime replacement for the old build-time
`REACT_APP_*_AUTH_ENABLED` flags.

## Typed domain RPC contract

The protobuf package defines typed services for catalogs, schemas, tables,
volumes, functions, registered models and model versions, and metric views.
The implementation is split across the two-PR stack tracked by
[issue #1888](https://github.com/unitycatalog/unitycatalog/issues/1888) and
[issue #1889](https://github.com/unitycatalog/unitycatalog/issues/1889):

1. The contract PR adds the messages and `buf.validate` rules and keeps
   TypeScript generation working.
2. The implementation PR generates and registers the Rust Connect services,
   enforces the rules with
   [protovalidate-buffa](https://docs.rs/protovalidate-buffa/latest/protovalidate_buffa/),
   translates the typed requests to UC REST, and uses typed connect-query hooks
   in the SPA.

`UnityProxyService/Call` remains for auth, SCIM, and permissions endpoints that
are outside these domain contracts. Generated files under `web/src/gen/` and
Cargo's `OUT_DIR` are reproducible and must not be edited by hand.

## Prerequisites

- Bun 1.3+
- Rust (stable) / cargo
- Buf (or `bun install` in `web/`, which installs the local Buf CLI used by the
  Rust build script)
- A running Unity Catalog server (default `http://localhost:8080` — see the repo
  root `README.md` and `bin/start-uc-server`).

## Develop

Install and generate once, then run two processes. The bridge proxies to UC;
Vite serves the SPA and proxies
`/uc.v1.*`, `/config`, and `/healthz` to the bridge.

```bash
# One-time setup
cd ui-new/web
bun install
bun run generate

# Terminal 1 — the Rust bridge (listens on :8081, proxies to UC on :8080)
cd ui-new/server
UC_SERVER=http://localhost:8080 cargo run

# Terminal 2 — the SPA dev server (listens on :5173, proxies RPCs to :8081)
cd ui-new/web
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. Override the bridge target with
`VITE_API_TARGET=http://host:port bun run dev`.

To exercise the login flow, start the bridge with auth enabled:

```bash
UI_AUTH_ENABLED=true GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<client-id> UC_SERVER=http://localhost:8080 cargo run
```

## Build artifacts

```bash
cd ui-new/web && bun run build          # -> web/dist
cd ../server && cargo build --release    # -> target/release/uc-ui-bridge
UC_SERVER=http://localhost:8080 ./target/release/uc-ui-bridge
```

Serve `web/dist` from a web server that proxies `/uc.v1.*`, `/config`, and
`/healthz` to the bridge. The container setup below supplies that Nginx layer.

## Containers

The default Compose file builds this checkout's Java server and starts the full
local stack: PostgreSQL metadata, RustFS object storage, the Rust bridge, and
the Nginx-hosted SPA. Local authorization is disabled by default. The
repository's `etc/conf` remains the configuration source; `rustfs-init` copies
it into a runtime volume and appends local S3 and PostgreSQL overrides.

```bash
cd ui-new
docker compose up --build
```

Open the UI at http://localhost:3000, Unity Catalog at
http://localhost:8080, and the RustFS console at http://localhost:9001
(`rustfsadmin` / `rustfsadmin` by default).

Use the remote Compose file to omit Unity Catalog, PostgreSQL, and RustFS and
point the bridge at an existing Unity Catalog deployment (caveat: the deployment must be OSS Unity Catalog):

```bash
export UC_SERVER=https://uc.YOUR_DOMAIN.dev # replace with your UC URL
export UI_AUTH_ENABLED=true
docker compose -f docker-compose-remote.yaml up --build
```

`UI_PORT`, `UC_PORT`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, and the `RUSTFS_*_PORT` variables change
the published local ports. Local state is kept in named volumes; remove it with
`docker compose down --volumes`.

Compose passes `~/.cargo/config.toml` and `~/.npmrc` into their build stages as
BuildKit secrets, so private registry settings are used without being stored in
the images. Override those paths with `CARGO_CONFIG_FILE` or `NPM_CONFIG_FILE`.
`CARGO_REGISTRY_URL` remains an explicit override and `NPM_REGISTRY_URL` an
explicit fallback; sparse Cargo registry URLs must end in `/`. The local Java
build also forwards `MAVEN_PROXY_URL` to the repository Dockerfile.

## Bridge configuration (env)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `8081` | Bridge listen port |
| `UC_SERVER` | `http://localhost:8080` | Unity Catalog server base URL |
| `UI_AUTH_ENABLED` | `false` | Gate the SPA behind login |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | _(empty)_ | Enables the Google sign-in button |
| `OKTA_AUTH_ENABLED` | `false` | Advertise Okta as enabled |
| `KEYCLOAK_AUTH_ENABLED` | `false` | Advertise Keycloak as enabled |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | _(empty)_ | Extra CORS origins (comma-separated); empty = same-origin only |

## Test

The SPA is tested with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + React Testing Library
(the standard Vite/React stack — Vitest reuses the Vite config). Coverage is
gated at 80% (statements/branches/functions/lines).

```bash
cd ui-new/web
bun run proto:check      # protobuf lint + build
bun run typecheck        # tsr generate + tsc
bun run test             # vitest run
bun run test:watch       # vitest (watch mode)
bun run test:coverage    # vitest run --coverage (enforces the 80% thresholds)

cd ../server && cargo test   # bridge unit/integration tests
```
